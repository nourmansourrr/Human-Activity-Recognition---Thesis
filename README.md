# HAR Project

## Overview
This repository contains a series of experiments related to Unsupervised Human Activity Recognition. Threre are three files. Each file corresponds to a different experiment conducted to investigate various aspects of the research.

## Files

- `HAR Data.zip`: This is a compressed folder containg all the dataset collected for this project, which includes three separate folders for each activity namely, climbing, running, and walking.
- `test.ipynb`: This experiment investigates BIRCH and Kmeans on the Arabic Spoken digit dataset. The primary focus is on testing the algorithms as well as the pre-processing techniques.
- `simpsomtest.ipynb`: This notebook contains experiments done with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) . The approach taken includes both whole time series and subsequence clustering.
- `allresults.ipynb`: This notebook contains experiments done on our HAR data, including experiments using 2D-DCT, feature extraction, sliding window technique, and online clustering .
